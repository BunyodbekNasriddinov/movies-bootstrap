                              Directed by Anthony and Joe Russo and written by

                              features an ensemble cast including Robert Downey
                              Jr., Chris Hemsworth, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Evans,
                              Scarlett Johansson, Benedict Cumberbatch, Don
                              Cheadle, Tom Holland, Chadwick Boseman, Paul
                              Bettany, Elizabeth Olsen, Anthony Mackie,

                              part of his quest to kill half of all life in the
                              universe. The film was announced in October 2014
                              as Avengers: Infinity War – Part 1. The Russo
                              brothers came on board to direct in April 2015,
                              and a month later Markus and McFeely signed on to
                              write the script for the film, which draws
                              inspiration from Jim Starlin's 1991 comic book The
                              Infinity Gauntlet and Jonathan Hickman's 2013
                              comic book Infinity. In 2016, Marvel shortened the
                              title to Avengers: Infinity War. Filming began in
                              January 2017 at Pinewood Atlanta Studios in
                              Fayette County, Georgia, with a large cast
                              consisting mostly of actors reprising their roles
                              from previous MCU films, including Brolin as
                              Thanos. The production lasted until July 2017,
                              shooting back-to-back with a direct sequel,
                              Avengers: Endgame (2019). Additional filming took
                              place in Scotland, the Downtown Atlanta area, and
                              New York City. With an estimated budget of
                              $325–400 million, the film is one of the most
                              expensive films ever made. Avengers: Infinity War
                              premiered in Los Angeles on April 23, 2018, and
                              was released in the United States on April 27, as
                              part of Phase Three of the MCU. The film received
                              praise for Brolin's performance, visual effects,
                              action sequences, and emotional weight. The film
                              was the fourth film and the first superhero film
                              to gross over $2 billion worldwide, breaking
                              numerous box office records, and becoming the
                              highest-grossing film of 2018 and the
                              fourth-highest-grossing film of all time both
                              worldwide and in the United States and Canada. It
                              received a nomination for Best Visual Effects at
                              the 91st Academy Awards, among numerous other
                              accolades. The sequel, Avengers: Endgame, was
                              released in April 2019.

                              Iron Man is a superhero appearing in American
                              comic books published by Marvel Comics. The
                              character was co-created by writer and editor Stan
                              Lee, developed by scripter Larry Lieber, and
                              designed by artists Don Heck and Jack Kirby. The
                              character made his first appearance in Tales of
                              Suspense #39 (cover dated March 1963), and
                              received his own title in Iron Man #1 (May 1968).
                              Also in 1963, the character founded the Avengers
                              alongside Thor, Ant-Man, Wasp and the Hulk. A
                              wealthy American business magnate, playboy,
                              philanthropist, inventor and ingenious scientist,
                              Anthony Edward Stark suffers a severe chest injury
                              during a kidnapping. When his captors attempt to
                              force him to build a weapon of mass destruction,
                              he instead creates a mechanized suit of armor to
                              save his life and escape captivity. Later, Stark
                              develops his suit, adding weapons and other
                              technological devices he designed through his
                              company, Stark Industries. He uses the suit and
                              successive versions to protect the world as Iron
                              Man. Although at first concealing his true
                              identity, Stark eventually publicly reveals
                              himself to be Iron Man. Initially, Iron Man was a
                              vehicle for Stan Lee to explore Cold War themes,
                              particularly the role of American technology and
                              industry in the fight against communism.
                              Subsequent re-imaginings of Iron Man have
                              transitioned from Cold War motifs to contemporary
                              matters of the time.[1] Throughout most of the
                              character's publication history, Iron Man has been
                              a founding member of the superhero team the
                              Avengers and has been featured in several
                              incarnations of his own various comic book series.
                              Iron Man has been adapted for several animated
                              television shows and films. In the Marvel
                              Cinematic Universe, Tony Stark was portrayed by
                              Robert Downey Jr. in the films Iron Man (2008),
                              The Incredible Hulk (2008), Iron Man 2 (2010), The
                              Avengers (2012), Iron Man 3 (2013), Avengers: Age
                              of Ultron (2015), Captain America: Civil War
                              (2016), Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017), Avengers:
                              Infinity War (2018), and Avengers: Endgame (2019),
                              while Mick Wingert voiced the character in the
                              animated series What If...? (2021).
